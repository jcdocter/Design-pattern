- How the implementation went
the implementation went a little stif and i think that it isn't implemented as is should. On the other hand i'm motivated to do 
more reseacrh on this subject. While i was working on the design pattern, i had no time to refactor my code. 

- Did you deviate from any example/resource implementation? If so, why?
just a little because i tried to work with a input system and here for i needed to try different things.

files i made/changed:
                - playerMovement.cs
                - Icommand.cs
                - IGameObjectCommand.cs
                - InputHandler.cs
                - GameManager.cs
                - JumpCommand.cs
